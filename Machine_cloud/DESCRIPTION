Description : This toolbox has a collection off functions that help you register and use pre-written python scripts or your custom machine learning scripts on the cloud. It work after installing some pre-requisite scripts onto your user on the server, adding your key to the metadata for the server and installing the dependencies (PIMS) onto your machine. One can then use the cloud for a machine lerning experience on the fly. The pre-installed scripts are :

decision_tree_classification.py
decision_tree_regression.py
heirarchial_clustering.py
kmeans_clustering.py
knn_classification.py
linear_regression.py
logistic_regression.py
multiple_linear_regression.py
naive_bayes_GaussianNB.py
naive_bayes_MultinomialNB.py
principal_component_analysis.py
random_forest_classification.py
support_vector_regression.py

Each of these scripts has a pre-defined data format that you need to give as input, and a pre-defined output format which is saved as attributes.p onto your local machine.
