## The great journey

I never expected this to end so fast. The GSoC journey was exquisite. I was part of a GSoC program earlier and to be honest, this was much more different than like it. If you are mildly interested in making a contribution and are enthusiastic to a certain extent, the open source community for Scilab recieves you with open arms and a box of chocolates.

There were ups and downs, decisions taken but we never stopped.
